# Lab6_Bivariate_Bigfoot
This map was developed as an example of bivariate symbolization using point and area-level data in the web mapping environment. It depicts cryptid sightings per county in NC, overlaid with the population density of each county. Cryptids such as Bigfoot have strong ties to Appalachian folklore and storytelling. Choropleth symbolization and the chroma.js library are used to visualize the number of recorded sightings per county. Placemarker visualization of each short-term rental location is depicted using the Font Awesome icon library and the chroma.js library to highlight categorical differences in the number of sightings.
